# The Law Firm - Fictional Law Firm Website

This project was built just to show case that I am able to stick with the basics using only HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is just a template for a fictional law firm. It uses JavaScript to trigger animation when you scroll to specific section of the page. It was built using mobile first design and is also responsive using media queries.
